# Gatsby starter for simple PWA's
This starter implements [gatsby-theme-simpwa](https://github.com/davidde/gatsby-theme-simpwa)
to provide a generic, re-usable and modular layout for developing simple PWA's
(Progressive Web Applications) with responsive sidebars on the left and right.

The intended use case is for **simple web apps** aiming to present themselves as close
as possible to native mobile apps. The idea here is that a simple app can stuff all
its content in the main screen and its left/right sidebars.

## Installation
```bash
gatsby new my-awesome-app https://github.com/davidde/gatsby-starter-simpwa
```

Check out the [theme's README](https://github.com/davidde/gatsby-theme-simpwa)
for more information.
